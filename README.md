## üíª About project

Personal project built to generate a perfect palette colors to use in your project, with three main colors respecting the rule of 60-30-10.
The colors are calculated using HSL and then they are trasnformed to hex colors. Sometimes it is hard to find a good combination, so I made this generator to help me with new ideas and combinations. Feel free to use this project and get new ideas for your next project.
